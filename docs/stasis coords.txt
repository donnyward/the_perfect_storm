4 blocks wide = 100 pixels
2 blocks high = 50 pixels

(rounded up) top left corner of box = (458, 190)
bottom right corner of box = (576, 284)

box width = 118 pixels
9 pixels on each side to center

box height = 94 pixels
44 pixels on top and bottom

so if a block is in the top left corner, the coord of the topleft of that 1st block is (458+9, 190+44). (467, 234)

for each block to the right, add 25 to that
for each block below, add 25 to that
